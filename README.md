**This was a p2c I was going to make for some random, He failed to pay so I made a shit paste for him then sent to ritz, Ritz leaked it and I got disabled so everyone thought I exit scammed "again" thuough that's not true my new account is TrueAim#1515....This is nuclear base modified with UE4 Canvas, I removed Waypoint TP and Carfly...So remove those functions, Silent is removed because I'm not that braindead only decent exploit is GetViewInfo FOV changer/maven Everything is detected I'd say around 5 games. I've already seen 3 servers use this base and claim its ud and are selling it so credits would be awesome..
